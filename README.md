# Cereal-Data-Analysis
Introduction to Data Science Project
Using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals

The repo contains the Python notebook along with the final submited PDF with out findings.

The PDF contains the findings and visualizations of our finding, while the notebook was used to clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data which would later be posted in our final submitted PDF.


The main question was:

Is the rating of cereal brands affected by factors such as shelf placement, sugar content, and number of calories per serving?

The PDF includes our question, hypothesis, background information, visualizations, ethical considerations and much more.
