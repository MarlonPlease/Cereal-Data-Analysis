Introduction to Data Science Project
Using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals

The repo contains the Python notebook along with the final submited PDF with out findings.

The PDF contains the findings and visualizations of our finding, while the notebook was used to clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data which would later be posted in our final submitted PDF.


Question

Is the rating of cereal brands affected by factors such as shelf placement, sugar content, and number of calories per serving?

Hypothesis

We hypothesize that cereals with high amounts of sugar, high calories and that are lowest
on the shelf – closest to children’s eye levels – correlate to a higher rating of the cereal
brand.

Background information...
The rest of the data is on the Final PDF.
